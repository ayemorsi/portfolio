            <h3>Amazon</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on a three-month project to design a safety reporting application for Amazon employees. The goal was to replace the manual, paper-based process with a quick and easy digital solution. This required maintaining compatibility with the existing backend and simplifying the complex hazard classification process for less experienced users.
              <br><br>
              I conducted usability testing with 30 participants and iterated based on feedback, improving reporting accuracy from 51% to 93%. I collaborated with a UX writer to simplify hazard terminology and created clear descriptions to guide users. The final design allowed employees to submit safety concerns efficiently while maintaining data integrity.

My ability to bridge technical and user needs allowed me to deliver seamless, impactful solutions that exceeded client expectations.

            <h3>ZoomScript</h3>
            <p>
              In 2016, I worked on ZoomScript, a modern application designed to simplify prescription management and refills for patients. Over four weeks, I conducted market research, competitive analysis, and usability testing to understand patient pain points. Insights from 15 user interviews and surveys revealed that 86% of participants found traditional refill methods cumbersome and slow.
              <br><br>
              As a UX/UI designer and researcher, I crafted low-fi to high-fi prototypes using tools like Adobe XD and Photoshop. The result was an intuitive mobile solution enabling patients to manage and refill prescriptions conveniently, addressing the need for a more seamless pharmacy experience.
